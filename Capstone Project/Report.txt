INTRODUCTION
This project, involves the use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for
three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The project involves writing code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive
statistics. it also involves writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in
the terminal to present these statistics.

SOFTWARE USED
To complete this project, the following software were reqiured:
-Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
-A text editor, Visual Studio Code
-A terminal application (Cygwin on Windows).

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in
cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term
basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B,
though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless,
each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a
dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of
data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, the data used were provided by Motivate - https://www.motivateco.com/ ...a bike
share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage
patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York
City, and Washington, DC.

DATASET
The Datasets were randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 as provided for all three cities. All three
of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year.

FILE SOURCES
The original files are much larger and messier, they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them:
Chicago(https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), 
New York City(https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data),
Washington(https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data). 

These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some data wrangling has been performed to
condense these files to the above core six columns to make the analysis and the evaluation of
your Python Script more straightforward. 

STATISTICS COMPUTED
In this project, code  were written to provide the following information:
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end
station)

#3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

CONCLUSION
The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive
experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is
interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous
page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or
Sunday?
The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which you'll do
data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and
choose to start again or exit.

Thanks so much to the WeJapa Internship and the mentorship for this knowledge and impact share in the course of this
program in bringing me from a novice to this stage as a Data Scientist. God Bless and reward you accordingly.
GRACIAS........
